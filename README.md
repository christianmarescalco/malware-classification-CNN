# Malware Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
This GitHub repository contains an implementation of a malware classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal of this project is to develop a model capable of accurately classifying different types of malware based on their input executable as an image.

## Introduction
Malware (malicious software) poses a significant threat to computer systems and networks worldwide. It is crucial to detect and classify malware accurately to prevent potential security breaches. This project focuses on leveraging the power of CNNs, a deep learning technique commonly used in computer vision tasks, to classify malware samples into different categories.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains labeled samples of different types of malware. Each sample is stored in a separate directory, with the directory name indicating the malware class. The dataset is organized in the following structure:

```
dataset/
├── class1/
│ ├── malware1.png
│ ├── malware2.png
│ ├── ...
├── class2/
│ ├── malware3.png
│ ├── malware4.png
│ ├── ...
├── ...
```

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture used in this project consists of several convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers and fully connected layers. The details of the model architecture can be found in the `presentation.ppt` file.
